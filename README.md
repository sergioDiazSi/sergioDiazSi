## Welcome!

I'm Sergio Diaz, a systems engineering student based in Peru. I have experience with various technologies including Express.js, Next.js, React.js, and Java. I enjoy working on projects that involve these technologies and am particularly interested in JavaScript technologies for both frontend and backend development. I enjoy writing blogs about the things that I am learning and sharing my knowledge with others.

ðŸŒ± Now I am learning Swift.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about whatever you want. I am interested in helping and sharing.

â˜• I like coffee.
